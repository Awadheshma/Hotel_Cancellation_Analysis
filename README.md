## Project: Hotel Cancellation Analysis

### Business Problem
In recent 2-3 years City and Resort hotel have seen high cancellation rate. It result in decrease in hotels revenue.
And less occupancy leading to more ideal room, which are not generating any money but require extra maintainance.
The goal is to identify the reason for the higher cancellation and providing recommendation to hotels to reduce cancellation
### Research Question
1- What are the variables that are affecting the reservation cancellation?

2- How can we do to reduce the cancellation?

### Hypothesis
1- Higher price leads to higher cancellation.

2- Longer waiting time while booking leads to cancellation

3- Majority Customer are coming from Offline Travel Agents

### Insights
1-  Combined in Resort and City hotels successful bookings are 63% and 37% of bookings are being cancelled.

2-  Cancellation Rate in Resort hotel is 13% less compared to City Hotel which is 40%.

3-  December & January are experiencing lowest booking and also highest cancellation.

4-  Online Travel Agents (MMT, Goibibo etc.) are contributing total of 46% of bookings & from those 45% are being cancelled.

5-  High Price directly leading to the most cancellation.

6-  Portugal country is facing the highest cancellation rate 77%

### Recommendation
-  As per or analysis it is proved that Cancellation is increasing as the price are increasing. In Order to prevent cancellation 
   stakeholders could work on their pricing statategies.
   
-  Cancellation rate is 27% in Resort hotel which is 13% less than City hotel but then also its high. Resort hotel should do        more marketing with discounts.
    - One Primary reason for cancellation in Resoet hotel can be higher price, Offering discount could increase booking and           reduce cancellation further.
   
-  The Cancellation rate in City hotel is very high more than 40% . The main reson for cancellation in City Hotels are Online      travel Agents (MMT, Goibibo) etc.  
    - City hotels should make sure they should write facilities and post photos which they are actually offering. Because             Customer tends to cancel the booking when it does not meet his expectation.
    
    -  Sometime Customer may books a hotel and cancel because he found better option, Try to give them offers/discounts
    
    -  Provide facilities as promised, because if customer give bad review on Online Platform it would drastically decrease your        booking count.
    
- In December and January Booking is very less and Cancellation is approx. 50%.  Hotel should reduce the prices in this two       months and should do marketing and promotion to increase Bookings.

- Portugal is the country whose cancellation rate is more than 75%. They should revise the pricing and provide more facilities     services to avoid cancellation
